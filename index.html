<h2>Biography:</h2>
<p> My name is Doug, I am a pug. I am applying to become a Teenage Mutant Ninja Pug. I am a very good doggo and like many treats in me belly. I am potty trained and typically eat things off the floor when mom isn't looking. I am full of smarts and don't really make a lot of choices but when I do they are usually good. Mom tells me I am a good boy. I woof at things that confuse me, most things confuse me. I have a lot of fans on the Facebook, I don't know what fans are but I think they make me cold. I don't like to run because I am a pug so I usually can't breathe most of the time. Sometimes I snore in my sleep and have bad dreams about big dogs chasing me, I am rather short for my age. I don't know how old I am but age is just a number, right? Here is my music video of me, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj_emVFPgJ8" >video </a> doing a thing to a good tune. Here are some other fun facts about me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> I smile at people when I am mad because I am petty</li>
    <li> I fall asleep when my belly is rubbed</li>
    <li> Sometimes I snore while I am awake </li>
    <li> I can eat two treats at once </li>
    <li> My singing voice is a combination of Jesus and Fergie</li>
